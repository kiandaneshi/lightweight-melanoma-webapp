## üìù Code Guidelines

### Python Code (Training Pipeline)
```python
# Use type hints
def train_model(config: Dict[str, Any]) -> Tuple[float, str]:
    pass

# Follow PEP 8 style guide
# Use descriptive variable names
# Add docstrings to functions

def preprocess_image(image_path: str, target_size: int = 384) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Preprocess medical image for model input.
    
    Args:
        image_path: Path to input image
        target_size: Target image size in pixels
        
    Returns:
        Preprocessed image array
    """
```

### TypeScript Code (Web Application)
```typescript
// Use proper typing
interface ModelPrediction {
  confidence: number;
  prediction: 'benign' | 'melanoma';
  gradCam?: string;
}

// Follow consistent naming
const handleImageUpload = (file: File): Promise<ModelPrediction> => {
  // Implementation
};

// Add JSDoc comments for complex functions
/**
 * Processes uploaded image and returns melanoma classification
 * @param imageFile - The uploaded image file
 * @returns Promise containing prediction results
 */
```

### Code Style
- **Python**: Use Black formatter and isort for imports
- **TypeScript**: Use Prettier for formatting
- **Comments**: Write clear, concise comments
- **Variable Names**: Use descriptive names, avoid abbreviations

## üß™ Testing Guidelines

### Python Tests
```bash
cd training
python -m pytest tests/ -v
```

### Web Application Tests
```bash
cd web_app
npm run test
npm run test:coverage
```

### Test Requirements
- Unit tests for new functions
- Integration tests for major features
- Performance benchmarks for model changes
- Browser compatibility tests for UI changes
